## Data structure
```
ux0:data/noboru/cache/ - folder that holds cached manga info (also history)
(ux0/uma0):data/noboru/chapters/ - folder that holds chapters saved
(ux0/uma0):data/noboru/import/ - folder where you can store files you want to read locally or import to Library (0.35+)
ux0:data/noboru/parsers/ - folder for parsers
ux0:data/noboru/cusettings/ - folder for manga's custom settings
ux0:data/noboru/save.dat - library savefile
ux0:data/noboru/c.c - saved chapters info
ux0:data/noboru/settings.ini - application settings
```
You can just delete `noboru` folder to reset all settings
## Importing
So if you want to add your manga to library, you have four ways:
* You can import folder with images
* You can import folder with folders with images
* You can import folder with (.cbz, .zip) files
* You can import one (.cbz, .zip) file

Also if you want to read .cbz file directly you can just open file in import section<br><br>
<b>Requirements to .cbz or .zip file:</b>
* Names of images should end with .jpg .jpeg .png or .bmp (webp not supported yet)

<b>Requirements to folders:</b>
* No extra (non-image) files

CBR not supported (I'm working to find the way to support RAR archives, some images brakes and I just can't add that on this moment)
## Backup
If you want to backup, here's what you can backup
|Files|What saves|
|---|---|
|save.dat|Library list|
|settings.ini|Settings|
|history.dat + info.txt|History list|
|info.txt + cache folders (as many you want)|Bookmarks + Covers|
|c.c + chapters folders (as many you want)|Chapters|
|cusettings/*.ini|Custom settings for manga|

*Be careful, if you want to save chapters and don't search this chapter on internet you should backup History list*
## Known issues
<b>Issue</b> After importing archive file, manga/comic shows "Unknown error (Parser's)"<br>
<b>Advice</b> Make sure that archive file you have imported is supported.<br>
## FAQ
- **I've found a bug that ...**
    - You can create issue [here](https://github.com/Creckeryop/NOBORU/issues), give a screenshot with error or error file
- **How to view debug console?**
    - DPAD_LEFT + START
- **How to download chapters in background?**
    - There is only one way to download in background, don't press *power* button! Screen will shut by itself
- **Image is loading at the same speed as when downloading from network, is it broken?**
    - It is not broken, if you download chapters at the same time with reading. Image loading and downloading working in the one-thread mode. And your page that you are reading putted in queue, but if first task in queue is active, app can't cancel it not to corrupt data. That's why it is happening. If i will find a way to make it faster, i will make it faster.
- **Reader doesn't load some images**
    - Please create Issue and describe how you have come to this (Parser you used, Manga, Chapter and page). This app supports only JPEG, BMP and PNG formats. Make sure that image that you load isn't a gif or else. You can check network address through debug console.
- **I downloaded app and can't see any parsers**
    - Press Triangle to update parser list, so if that won't help, create issue [here](https://github.com/Creckeryop/NOBORU/issues)
- **How to setup proxy?**
    - You can write ip address like '192.169.0.1' or you can specify your proxy kind like 'socks5h://192.168.0.1' or "http", "https", "socks4a", "socks5", "socks5h"
- **Application slows down sometimes, when new manga is appearing**
    - That's a print function problem, all new characters that appear should be cached. In the first launch, app can't load all glyphs because it's a longtime process, so I load only Latin and Cryllic symbols.
## Building
Execute `build.bat` to create working .vpk
## TODO
* More languages
